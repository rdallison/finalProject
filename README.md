# final Capstone project

For this project I used HTML, CSS for the structure and styling of the website. For interaction on the webpage, I used Javascript. 

For the server side, I used a Node Express Server. 

When it comes to configuring the project, I used Webpack. There are four scripts that are available to run for this project. 

PRODUCTION: npm run build-prod
DEVELOPMENT: npm run build-dev
TEST: npm run test
START: npm run start

There are a few dependencies that were added to this project as well:
Babel
Sass
Service Workers

We have trip duration that has been added to the file. This functionality allows a user to select the date of travel and the return date. The travel time is then printed on the screen.
